Our project is to setup nginx setup and and makrdown the over all project scenario and submit it into github

# NGINX

NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.
<br>
The goal behind NGINX was to create the fastest web server around, and maintaining that excellence is still a central goal of the project. NGINX consistently beats Apache and other servers in benchmarks measuring web server performance. Since the original release of NGINX, however, websites have expanded from simple HTML pages to dynamic, multifaceted content. NGINX has grown along with it and now supports all the components of the modern Web, including WebSocket, HTTP/2, gRPC, and streaming of multiple video formats (HDS, HLS, RTMP, and others).

## STEPS

1. install nginx
2. check list
3. allow ' Nginx httpn '
4. check status 

<br>
After this we have to compile the whole setup with different commands like 

* start ningx 
* stop ningx
* reload 
* restart
* disable 
* enable 

## SUDO :

The sudo command is used to give such permissions to any particular command that a user wants to execute once the user enters a user password to give system based permission

### commands to execute nginx 

1. sudo apt install nginx
2. sudo ufw app list 
3. sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
4. sudo ufw status
5. systemctl status nginx
7. sudo systemctl stop nginx
8. sudo systemctl start nginx
9. sudo systemctl restart nginx
10. sudo systemctl reload nginx
11. sudo systemctl disable nginx
12. sudo systemctl enable nginx
